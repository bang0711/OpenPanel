# OpenPanel — project rules (always follow)

OpenPanel is a cPanel-style panel that manages remote Linux servers over SSH. **Bun-workspace
monorepo**: `apps/web` (Next.js 16 frontend, App Router, `proxy.ts` not middleware) ·
`apps/server` (standalone Elysia backend on Bun; entry `apps/server/src/index.ts` mounts the
Elysia app + Better Auth + CORS) · `packages/shared` (cross-boundary code, e.g. catalog data).
Stack: Better Auth (admin plugin, backend-side) · Prisma 7 (multi-file schema, `pg` adapter,
backend-only) · shadcn/ui (base-mira) · Bun. Web ⇄ backend is **same-origin**: the browser
calls `/api/*`, and `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` proxies it to the backend at runtime
(`API_BASE_URL`) — no CORS, no API URL in the client bundle. The web app has **no DB access**;
Server Components read via `apps/web/src/lib/server-fetch.ts` (attaches the session cookie
manually). The terminal is an in-process Elysia `.ws()` bridge on the API server (port 3001),
not a separate service. See `README.md` (Conventions) and `ROADMAP.md` (what to build next).

## Tooling
- **Always use Bun.** Install: `bun add` / `bun add -d` (add `--filter=@openpanel/<app>` to
  target a workspace). Add shadcn components with `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <name>` in
  `apps/web` (never hand-write UI primitives).
- The seed script runs under `tsx` (Node): `bun run seed`. Run both processes
  (web :3000 + API/ws :3001) with `bun run dev` from the repo root.
- Before finishing: in each touched app run `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bunx eslint --fix`.

## Backend — feature modules
Put each feature in `apps/server/src/server/modules/<feature>/`, split into:
- `<feature>.controller.ts` — Elysia routes only (HTTP concerns, status codes, auth macro).
- `<feature>.service.ts` — business logic as a **class** + exported singleton
  (`export const fooService = new FooService()`). Never put logic in the controller.
- `<feature>.schema.ts` — Elysia `t` validation schemas.
- `<feature>.constant.ts` — allowlists / constants / validation helpers.
Mount the controller in `apps/server/src/server/app.ts`. Guard every route with the
`auth`/`admin` macro. Server-scoped routes gate through **`authorize(serverId, user, action)`**
(`src/server/access.ts`) — `action` is `"read"` for GETs, `"write"` for mutations, `"admin"`
for destructive ops; it returns a `{ok,server}|{ok:false,code,error}` gate (owner/global-admin
bypass, else per-server `ServerPermission`). `loadOwnedServer` remains as the read shortcut.
Record privileged actions with `writeAudit(user.id, "<feature>.<action>", server.id)`. Personal
**API tokens** authenticate via `Authorization: Bearer` (see `plugins/auth.ts`). Background work
goes through the in-process scheduler: add a job in `src/server/jobs/` and register it in
`jobs/index.ts` (runs via `setInterval`, single instance). Cross-boundary code (shared by web +
server, e.g. catalog metadata) lives in `packages/shared` (`@openpanel/shared`).

## Frontend — API client & components
- All backend calls go through `apps/web/src/lib/api` — `api.<resource>.<method>()`. **Never**
  call `fetch` directly in a component (Server Components use `serverFetch` instead). The client
  calls same-origin `/api/*` (proxied to the backend by `proxy.ts`). One resource class per
  `resources/<name>.resource.ts`; types in `resources/<name>.type.ts`; endpoint paths in
  `endpoint.constant.ts` (`API_ENDPOINT`, server routes derive from one base).
- **One React component per file**, split small. Reusable pieces go in `components/common/`
  (`IconButton`, `ActionTooltip`, `RefreshButton`, `TextInputDialog`, `CommandOutputDialog`,
  `ServerStatusBadge`). Feature components in `components/<feature>/`.
- Tooltips: use `ActionTooltip` / `IconButton` (shadcn) — never the native `title` attribute.
- Memoize hot list rows (`memo`) and stabilize their handlers with `useCallback`.

## Security (non-negotiable)
- Never interpolate user input into a shell command. Validate with allowlists/regex; prefer
  SFTP over shell for file ops; feed dynamic content via stdin (`runCommandInput`) not the
  command string. Normalize remote paths to reject traversal.
- SSH credentials are encrypted at rest (`apps/server/src/lib/crypto.ts`); never return them to the client.
- Keep live infra data uncached (freshness = correctness). Only bundle/​cache immutable data.

## Imports
Grouped & ordered (auto-fixed by `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`): side-effect → react/next/
external → `@/lib|@/db|@/server` → `@/components/ui` → `@/components/*` → relative.

## Docs — keep in sync (required)
Whenever you add or change a feature, in the **same change**:
- Update `ROADMAP.md` — check off the shipped item / move it out of "Planned".
- Update `README.md` — reflect any new stack, script, env var, structure, or convention.
Do not consider a feature done until both docs are updated.

## i18n — keep all locales in sync (required)
- User-facing text goes through the `useT()` hook with a key in `apps/web/src/lib/i18n/messages.ts`.
  Do not hardcode display strings in client components.
- When you add a key, add it to **every** locale (`en` and `vi`) in the same change — never
  leave a locale missing a key. `en` is the fallback source of truth.
- Adding a new locale: add it to `LOCALES`, `LOCALE_NAMES`, a full dictionary, and an inline
  SVG flag in `components/common/flag-icon.tsx` (emoji flags don't render on Windows).
